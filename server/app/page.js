We were curious about this relationship to see if we could associate flavor preferences to Pok\xe9mon type and use this to assign each Pok\xe9mon to a drink. The resulting data shows some Pok\xe9mon types have a stronger correlation to a specific flavor, but not all types have this correlation. This is very insightful to our project as we had originally planned to match Pok\xe9mon to drinks through berry flavor preference, and the insight of this test showing there is not a significant relationship between type and berry flavor preference means we should consider other metrics related to specific Pok\xe9mon for matching them to certain drinks, such as weight or battle stats."})})]})]})]}),(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"w-full h-full flex flex-col gap-5 ",children:[(0,d.jsx)("div",{id:"ml",className:"bg-[#4996FF] my-2 border-y-3 border-gray-700 text-white text-shadow-3d text-7xl px-2.5",children:"MACHINE LEARNING"}),(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"w-full h-full flex flex-row items-stretch justify-center text-2xl px-12 gap-6",children:[(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-5/12 h-full",children:[(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col w-full rounded-2xl h-full border-gray-700 border-3",children:[(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"bg-[#FFCF52] rounded-t-xl py-1 px-5 text-gray-700 text-shadow-3d-white flex items-center text-5xl",children:"SUPERVISED LEARNING"}),(0,d.jsx)("div",{className:"flex bg-white rounded-b-xl p-5 justify-center text-3xl",children:"Given the insights from our statistical tests, we wanted to explore whether we could predict if a Pok\xe9mon is legendary, mythical, or baby using patterns in the data."})]}),(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-5 flex flex-row w-full rounded-2xl h-full border-gray-700 border-3 bg-[#FFCF52] px-2.5 py-1.5 items-stretch",children:[(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:" rounded-t-xl py-1 px-2.5 text-gray-700 text-shadow-3d-white flex items-center text-4xl",children:"TECHNIQUE:"}),(0,d.jsx)("div",{className:"flex items-center justify-center bg-white rounded-xl px-2  border-3 border-gray-700 text-2xl text-shadow-3d-yellow",children:"Decision Tree Classifier"})]})]}),(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col h-auto w-full items-center justify-center bg-[#4FCC64] rounded-2xl border-gray-700 border-3 p-5",children:[(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"text-5xl text-shadow-3d-white text-gray-700",children:"RESULTS"}),(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-4 flex flex-col w-full h-full gap-5",children:[(0,d.jsx)("div",{className:"flex relative justify-center items-center",children:(0,d.jsx)(aY(),{src:"/tables/classifier_findings.png",alt:"classifier accuracies table",width:900,height:300})}),(0,d.jsx)("div",{className:"flex rounded-2xl w-full h-full border-gray-700 border-3 bg-white p-5 text-3xl",children:"Our model performed well on the is_legendary and is_mythical classifications, achieving high accuracy and F1 scores above 0.7.

Then, our classifer cannot accurately predict baby Pok\xe9mon and is also predicting false positives. We theorize that this is because baby Pok\xe9mon have the least amount of data to train on and there is too much noise around the features. Looking at the Pok\xe9mon database, baby Pok\xe9mon are relatively weak and frail, and weak Pok\xe9mon are more common in contrast to legendary and mythical Pok\xe9mon who are selectively strong or excellent -- if all Pok\xe9mon were as strong, then the games would not be as interesting!
