We theorize that this is because baby Pok\xe9mon have the least amount of data to train on and there is too much noise around the features. Looking at the Pok\xe9mon database, baby Pok\xe9mon are relatively weak and frail, and weak Pok\xe9mon are more common in contrast to legendary and mythical Pok\xe9mon who are selectively strong or excellent -- if all Pok\xe9mon were as strong, then the games would not be as interesting! There is nothing we can do to further clean the data for our specific model, as this noise is built into the dataset itself, but adding regularization methods would probably improve the performance."})]})]})]}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"w-full h-full flex flex-row items-stretch justify-center text-2xl  px-12 gap-6 mt-20",children:[(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-5/12 h-full",children:[(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col w-full rounded-2xl h-full border-gray-700 border-3",children:[(0,t.jsx)("p",{className:"bg-[#FFCF52] rounded-t-xl py-1 px-5 text-gray-700 text-shadow-3d-white flex items-center text-[44px]",children:"UNSUPERVISED LEARNING"}),(0,t.jsx)("div",{className:"flex bg-white rounded-b-xl p-5 justify-center text-3xl",children:"For our interactive component, we want to assign Pok\xe9mon to drinks and thought that flavors would be a unique connection.

Overall, we are satisfied with the clustering and think that the categorizations are super interesting! Something that is also interesting to note is that the clustering was able to group baby Pok\xe9mon more accurately than our supervised learning method. We reason that this is again because there is a limited number of baby Pok\xe9mon, such that it would be difficult to train on the data as the baby Pok\xe9mon would be split across the training, test, and validation sets. However, with clustering, the model is able to train on the entire dataset, giving it more context to create natural groupings.']})]})]})]})]})]})})}},3243:(e,a,i)=>{Promise.resolve().then(i.bind(i,1920))}},e=>{var a=a=>e(e.s=a);e.O(0,[545,24,441,684,358],()=>a(3243)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
